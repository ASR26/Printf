For ft_printf we'll need to get a variable ammount of arguments, for this reaso we'll use some functions which can do that, those are va_start, va_end, va_cpy and va_arg.
We need to handle some conversions:
-c (character)
-s (string)
-p (pointer)
-d (digit)
-i (integer)
-u (unsigned int)
-x (hexadecimal lowcase)
-X (hexadecimal uppercase)
-% (prints a percentsign)
